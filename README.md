# Clipboard Buddy

### _A simple MacOS clipboard history app_

This simple Python based app provides a history for your clipboard, locally storing the last 15 clipboard entries in an easy-access Menu Bar app. 

This tool was built because I often would copy a note, forget to paste it elsewhere, and have to go back and recreate the note again. With this tool, your previous clipboard entries aren't lost!
